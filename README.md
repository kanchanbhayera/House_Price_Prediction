# UK House Price Prediction Model

## Overview

This project aims to predict house prices in the UK using machine learning techniques, incorporating both property-specific features and economic indicators. The model leverages a comprehensive dataset of UK property transactions from 2012 to 2022, combined with geographical and economic data to provide accurate price predictions.

## Features

- Data Integration: Merges property transaction data with postcode information, local authority districts, and ITL (International Territorial Level) codes.
- Geospatial Analysis: Utilizes latitude and longitude data for location-based predictions.
- Time Series Analysis: Incorporates historical price trends from 2012 to 2022.
- Machine Learning Model: Implements advanced regression techniques for price prediction.

## Dataset

The dataset includes:

- Property transaction details (price, date, type, etc.)
- Geographical information (postcode, latitude, longitude)
- Administrative boundaries (Local Authority District, ITL codes)

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
